        <h1>Wonton Recipe</h1>
        <img src="wonton.jpg" width="1505">
        <p>If you’ve ever had store bought frozen wontons or wontons from a good value Chinese place that probably uses frozen wontons, you will be amazed how different homemade ones are. The main difference is the texture of the filling – because homemade wontons are made with just pure fresh ingredients, NO mysterious fillers!

        I think wontons are one of those things that many people don’t think to make, assuming they are really tedious and take ages. But they don’t!! The wonton filling takes minutes to make (literally – 5 minutes) and wrapping the wontons is quite fast if you use my method!</p>
        <p>There are so many ways to prepare wonton filling and soup. For example,you make chicken wonton soup, Watercress wonton or add noodles into the soup to make cantonese style wonton noodles soup. You can even use hot sauce as a base to make Sichuan style spicy wontons.</p>
        <P>In this post i want to <strong>introsduce the most basic and classic verion- it uses shrimp and ground pork</strong>.</P>
        
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li> shrimp</li>
            <li> Ground pork</li>
            <li> Ginger</li>
            <li> Green onion</li>
            <li> Soy sauce</li>
            <li> Sesame oil <em>to make richa nd flavourful filling that taste so, so good</em>.</li>
        </ul>

        <p> This is how in China, we Northeners make wonton. We like to add plenty of aromatics and seasonings to make the filling very rich, so the wontons taste great even by themselves. </p>
        
        <h3>How to make wonton soup</h3>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Prepare the filling (with or without a food processor):</strong> In Chinese kichen, home cooks always hand chop all the ingredients. This is because most chinese families do not own a food processor. Plus, many people enjoy the texture that is made by hand chopping. If you want to make prep easier you can totally use a food processor or a blender to mix the filing. In this case, you can simply slice the ginger and green onion into coarse pieces. Add all the filling ingredients except the shrimp into food processor. Process until it forms a silky paste. Then add the shrimp and blend until the shrimp are finely chopped, but do not turn into a paste.</li>
            <li><strong>Wrap the wontons:</strong> <p>The simplest way is to roll up the filling in a wrapper and press both loose ends together to lock in the filling.</p><p>There is a good chance that the wrapper will not be sticky enough and you'll have troubke pressing the ends together. To solve this problem, you can brush some water onto the edgesof the wrapper with your finger, so the wrapper will stay together while cooking.</p> </li>
            <li><strong>Prepare soup base:</strong> <p> I introduced two types of wonton broth in the recipe below.</p> <p><em>Traditional Chinese Street vendor style soup</em> uses papery dried shrimp, dried seaweed, a bit of chicken bouilion, some soy sauce and a touch of sesame oil to turn the boiling water into a simple and tasty soup that's full of umami.</p><p> <em>Chicken broth based soup</em> that you can easily get in most grocery stores.</p></li>
            <li><strong>Put everything together:</strong> Once you've wrapped the wontons and made the soup, all you need to do is boil the wontons and assemble the bowls. I love to wrap my wontons in a big batch and freeze them in a small portions, so i can have freshly made wonton soup ready in 5 minutes on a busy weekday.</li>

        </ol>

        <h3> To make single serving</h3>
        <p> Boil the number of wontons you plan to serve; 8 to 10 wontons to serve as a light snack, 6-8 for an appetizer, 12-15 for a main dish. for each 8-10 wontons, boil 1 cup of soup.</p>
