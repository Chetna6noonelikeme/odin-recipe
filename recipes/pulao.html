        <h3>About Pulao</h3>
        <P>Pulao is one pot rice dish made by cooking fragrant basmati rice with whole aromatic spices,herbs and sometimes stock. There are many kinds of pulao made in India such as Matar pulao,Tawa pulao and Chicken pulao.</P>
        <p>This veg pulao is the most basic dish and is made often times in many Indian homes.you will also find it always on Parties, Buffets and Celebration menus.</p>

        <p>A perfectly cooked vegetable pulao should have fluffy,separate rice grains that are not stick and mushy yet fully cooked.The dish must have unique aroma of mint and whole spices like cinnamon,cardamoms and cloves</p>
        <P>My recipe will lead you to the same experience of a culture.</P>


        <h3>Ingredients and it's substitutes:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Spices:</strong> Always use good quality whole spices as they are the key to make aromatic veg pulao. You can also crush the spices lightly and use to release the aroma. There is no substitute to bay leaf, cloves, cinanamom, cardamoms and star anise. While you may skip the rest your pulao won't really have those aromatic flavours.</li>
            <li><strong>Ginger Garlic Paste:</strong> can be substituted with grated ginger and garllic but not with chopped or with ground dried ginger and garlic. You won't get the same flavours. </li>
            <li><strong>Herbs:</strong> Do not skip fresh mint or pudina leavesas it the next key ingredient that infuses aromato the veg pulao. If you want, You may add a mix of coriander leaves(Cilantro) and mint. If fresh is not available may use a teaspoon of mint paste.</li>
            <li><strong>Rice:</strong> Normally aged <em>basmati rice</em> is used to make veg pulao. But if you do not have, just use any other kind of rice that is non sticky. You will need to adjust water as needed depending on the rice.</li>
            <li><strong>Mixed Vegetables:</strong> I normally use caarrots, green beans, potatoes, sweet corn, baby corn and peas depending on the availability. Opt for frozen veggies to save time. Frozen veggies don't require sauteing so you may pour water immediately after adding them to the pot.</li>
        </ul>
